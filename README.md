## Why is this Open Source?
##### Well, I thought it should be an open source website for everyone to be able to see, use, and check out my progress in web development. Sure, I am going to look back on A LOT of this code and think wow this sucks, but it is here to show my growth and get some community feedback on what to add, have bug fixes, and so on.

## Will I personally push updates?
### Yes. #####I will be adding more features.
